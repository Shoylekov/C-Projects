# Super Market Billing System
## Overview
The Super Market Billing System is a simple command-line application that allows users to manage a supermarket's billing operations. Users can add items to the inventory, view available items, and calculate the total bill for purchases. The application demonstrates basic file handling, data validation, and user interaction in C++.

# Features
### Add Items: Users can add items to the store's inventory with details such as item name, price, and quantity.
### View Available Items: Before shopping, users can view all available items in the store.
### Shopping: Users can enter the item and quantity they wish to purchase, and the application will calculate the total amount.
### Bill Calculation: The total bill is calculated and displayed at the end of the shopping session.
### Data Persistence: Item details are stored in a text file (Bill.txt) for persistence between program runs.
# Prerequisites
A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks)
